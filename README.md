# Caesar-Cipher
######  This is a simple Cipher that you can encrpyt messages and have fun with. Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher, in which each letter in the plain text is replaced by another letter at some fixed positions from the current letter in the alphabet.
## Requirements
###### Nothing required just have python and your code editor (https://www.python.org/downloads/ ) There is the link to download it on your computer

## Usage
###### You can python3 and the file name to try out both .py files. One is for decrypting which is decrpyt.py and Cipher.py is the main code to test your messages out and decode them (New feature added) You can now encrypt plain text files and decrpyt them to your lesiure. To do this you can either make your own file or use the one I made and change it. Then by passing the encrypted file path as an input and setting the ‘decrypt’ parameter to True
